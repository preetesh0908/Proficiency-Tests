*My name is Preetesh Patodi*, **and I am from India.** I am a senior at Indiana University who started his senior year with a major scooter accident. I love my tiny collection of books and enjoy my time listening to music and watching TV shows. I like to think that I am the biggest fan of Breaking Bad. My dream is to be a digital nomad so that I can focus on my passion of history by travelling around the world. My degree at IU includes:

- Major: Informatics
- Cognate: Business
- Minors: History, Human-Centered Computing, Financial Literacy
