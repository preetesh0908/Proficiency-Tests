Proficiency 03
---
This is my third proficiency exercise.
In this exercise, I made a webpage using HTML and JavaScript. The website lets the user calulate on a limited basis, and gives an option to the user to find the associated Magic Number from an external server.

Here's the link for the exercise: https://cgi.sice.indiana.edu/~ppatodi/ITP3.php
