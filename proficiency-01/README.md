Proficiency 01
---
This is my first proficiency exercise.

In this exercise, I made a webpage using PHP. The website greets the user with "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening", based on the current time. This exercise helped me in brushing up my PHP skills.

Here's the link for the exercise: https://cgi.sice.indiana.edu/~ppatodi/ITP1.php
